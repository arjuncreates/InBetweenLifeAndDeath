# A short note
Hi! Welcome to this repository. _In Between Life and Death_ is a game programmed using p5.js for PSYCHE: a virtual exhibition that explores the mind hosted by the Science Gallery Bengaluru in April 2022. If you've played the game and have some feedback/want to improve the existing game/make something completely new altogether, feel free to do so. I'm always available @arjun.xperimenter@bengaluru.sciencegallery.com

## The thinking behind the game
I wanted to answer the question: _why do we do what we do_. Upon studying theories of human needs ranging from Maslow in 1943 to Max-Neef in 2010, I arrived at an understanding that there were systems of logic that drove human needs based on our nature as biological, social and conscious beings. While the range of theories listed above attempted to create an exhaustive list of human needs, the logical reasoning behind them was buried. 

Through a programmed game/experience, one could easily break down each of these seemingly complex human needs into systems of logic and apply them onto a digital object. This became the core idea for this game: to apply "complex" human needs to something as minuscule as a particle. 

I'm not a computer programmer by training and developing this game single handedly was an exciting (+often overwhelming) challenge. If you're interested in seeing how the project took shape, you can check out this blog: https://arjunsnotion.notion.site/Arjun-s-Thesis-4a732af0f22542128c1d80a64147557a

## Acknowledgements
Of course, no mountain can be conquered alone and this holds true for this project as well. 

I was fortunate to have had mentors who helped me develop this project with inputs from their own areas of expertise: Shaunaq, Saibal, Madhushree, Vasudha, Gayatri, Komal, Prof. Ramanujam, Prof. Gautham, Dr. Shashi & Dr. Jahanavi. To be able to include inputs from different areas of expertise and combine them into one single project has been a great honour. The learnings will stay with me forever. 

The Xperimenters cohort (Samyukta, Jyotsna & Snehaja) as well as my tiny friend group (Atreyo, Kriti and Alina) helped in various stages of this project by patiently testing and providing feedback that has managed to make the game "playable" today. A special thanks to Atreyo for mixing the music and Alina for helping me come up with a chunk of the storyline and frequently keeping track of my sanity. 

Hopefully, all of their efforts didn't go in vain.
