# InBetweenLifeAndDeath
A game programmed using p5.js for Psyche (an exhibition season at the Science Gallery, Bengaluru in April 2022).

# A short note
Hello! Thanks for viewing this repository. If you've played the game already and would like to modify the code to make your own, you're most welcome to do so. Let me know what you end up creating by emailing me at arjun.xperimenter@bengaluru.sciencegallery.com

# Project Background
I wanted to answer the question of why we do what we do. Upon studying theories of human needs ranging from Maslow in 1943 to Max-Neef in 2010, I arrived at an understanding that there was a certain logical reasoning behind the listing of these needs that stemmed from our nature as biological, social and conscious beings. The development of this project took several turns and if you're interested, I suggest you to check out this blog which recorded everything that went into the making of this project: https://arjunsnotion.notion.site/Arjun-s-Thesis-4a732af0f22542128c1d80a64147557a
